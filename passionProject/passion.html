            <p class='space'>I like Programming because I like to see my ideas for websites in my 
                head turned into a reality.  First I get whatever picture or text I 
                plan to put on the site. Second I make a wireframe in something 
                like Figma. Third, I make it in HTML and CSS. </p>
                
            <p class='space'>I was introduced to programming by freecodeCamp and Code Academy. 
                FreecodeCamp and Code Academy taught me how to program in HTML 
                CSS and JS. I have since gotten better at HTML and CSS, and 
                designed a few basic sites. The website consisted of two basic 
                online stores and an art gallery. Today I am still learning JS 
                from FreecodeCamp and Codecademy.</p>
                
            <p class='space'>I like the amount of money I could make while being a programmer. 
                I also like the freedom, flexibility and ability to be a freelancer 
                while working remote from anywhere with an internet connection. </p>
                
            <p class='space'>The growth potential financially, and the freedom and flexibility 
                to work anywhere.</p>
