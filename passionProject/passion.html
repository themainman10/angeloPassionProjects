    <h1>Web Development</h1>
    <p>I like Programming because I like to see my ideas for websites in my 
        head turned into a reality.  First I get whatever picture or text I 
        plan to put on the site. Second I make a wireframe in something 
        like Figma. Third, I make it in HTML and CSS. </p>
    <p>I was introduced to programming by freecodeCamp and Code Academy. 
        FreecodeCamp and Code Academy taught me how to program in HTML 
        CSS and JS. I have since gotten better at HTML and CSS, and 
        designed a few basic sites. The website consisted of two basic 
        online stores and an art gallery. Today I am still learning JS 
        from FreecodeCamp and Codecademy.</p>
    <p>I like the amount of money I could make while being a programmer. 
        I also like the freedom, flexibility and ability to be a freelancer 
        while working remote from anywhere with an internet connection. </p>
    <p>The growth potential financially, and the freedom and flexibility 
        to work anywhere.</p>
